      <h2>Python Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Q: What are Python's key features?</strong>
          <p>A: Python is an interpreted, high-level, and dynamically typed programming language. Key features include easy syntax, vast libraries, support for multiple programming paradigms, and cross-platform compatibility.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Q: Explain the difference between lists and tuples in Python.</strong>
          <p>A: Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, while tuples are immutable and provide better performance for fixed data.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>C Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Q: What is a pointer in C?</strong>
          <p>A: A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It allows direct access and manipulation of memory locations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Q: What is the difference between malloc() and calloc()?</strong>
          <p>A: malloc() allocates a single block of memory, while calloc() allocates multiple blocks of memory and initializes all bytes to zero.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- C++ Section -->
    <section id="cpp" class="category-section">
      <h2>C++ Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1. What is the difference between C and C++?</strong>
          <p>C is a Procedural Oriented Programming (POP) language, whereas C++ language supports Object Orientation.
          Additionally, C++ supports features like templates, inheritance, function overloading, virtual functions,
          friend functions, and references. These features are not supported in C.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2. What does OOPS stand for?</strong>
          <p>OOPS stands for Object-Oriented Programming System, which is how C++ is categorized.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3. What is function overloading?</strong>
          <p>Function overloading is the concept of having many functions with the same name.
             These functions should have different parameters for different types of functioning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4. What is operator overloading?</strong>
          <p>Manipulating the operations of a pre-existing operator to achieve different operations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>5. What is a class in C++?</strong>
          <p>A class is a collection of different variables and different functions.
             The variables are called data members and the functions are called member functions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>6. What is a Friend Class?</strong>
          <p>If a class is mentioned as a friend class to another class, then it can access private and protected members of the other class.</p>
          <h4>Example:</h4>
          <pre>
        &lt;class ClassA&gt;
        {
          private:
            int a;
          public:
            ClassA()
            {
              a = 10;
            }
            friend class FriendClass;
        };
        class FriendClass
        {
          private:
            int b;
          public:
            void printClassA(ClassA&amp; p)
            {
              cout &lt;&lt; "a = " &lt;&lt; p.a &lt;&lt; endl;
            }
        };
        int main()
        {
          ClassA x;
          FriendClass y;
          y.printClassA();
          return 0;
        }
          </pre>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <strong>7. How can we access data members and member functions of a class?</strong>
          <p>Dot-Operator( . ) helps to access data members and member functions of a class. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>8. What is inheritance?</strong>
          <p>Inheritance is the feature in which an object acquires the properties of another class. </p>

          <strong>9. What are the different types of inheritances?</strong>
          <p>There are different types of Inheritances- </p>
        <p>1. Single inheritance</p>
        <p>2. Multiple inheritance</p>
        <p>3. Multi-level inheritance</p>
        <p>4. Hierarchical inheritance</p>
        <p>5. Hybrid inheritance</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>10. What is single inheritance?</strong>
          <p>In Single Inheritance, there is one derived class and one base class. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>11. What is multilevel inheritance?</strong>
          <p>In multi-level inheritance, a class is derived from another derived class. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>12. What is multiple inheritance?</strong>
          <p>This is when a class can be derived with more than one parent class. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>13. What is hierarchical inheritance?</strong>
          <p>In hierarchical inheritance, many classes are derived from a single parent class. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>14. What is Hybrid Inheritance?</strong>
          <p>This is a combination of more than one inheritance, called hybrid inheritance. It is also called virtual inheritance. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>15. What are access specifiers? What are the different types?</strong>
          <p>Access Specifiers define the accessibility of the members of the class. There are three types of access specifiers: </p>
          <p>1. Private – they are only accessible from inside of the class</p>
          <p>2. Protected – like private specifiers but with an extra feature — they are also accessible in derived classes</p>
          <p>3. Public – they are accessible from both inside and outside the class</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>16. What is Template?</strong>
          <p>A template is a method for creating generic classes and generic functions. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>17. What is a friend function?</strong>
          <p>A friend function to a class has access to all the members of the class, even the private ones. We declare it outside the class. </p>
